<h1>Using Linux commands to manage file permissions</h1>

<h2>Project description</h2>
The goal is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions which helps keep the system secure. I will be examining existing permissions on the file system to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not, I will modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access using various Linux commands. 


<h2>Check file and directory details</h2>
Navigated to <i>projects</i> directory via: <i>cd projects</i> </br>
Entered: <i>ls -la</i> to list the files/subdirectories, including those hidden, and their permissions: 
</br>

<h2>Describe the permissions string</h2>
The Linux permissions string is a set of 10 characters.</br>
The following describes <i>the project_k.txt</i> file permissions string in the above screenshot: </br>
-rw-rw-rw- 
</br></br>
The first character will either be a d (for directory) or a dash (for a file). </br>
In that example, it’s a - for a file. </br>
</br>
The string is grouped in 3’s and indicative of: user permission, group permission, and other permission: </br>
User: 2nd, 3rd, 4th characters </br>
Group: 5th, 6th, 7th characters </br>
Other: 8th, 9th, 10th characters </br>
</br>

The first character in each group is the for the read permission, indicated by the letter r. </br> 
If there is a -, the permission is not granted. (2nd, 5th, 8th characters) </br>

The second character in each group is for the write permissions, indicated by the letter w. </br>
If there is a -, the permission is not granted. (3rd, 6th, 9th characters) </br>

The third character in each group is for the execute permissions, indicated by the letter x. </br>
If there is a -, the permission is not granted. (4th, 7th, 10th characters) </br>
</br>

<h2>Change file permissions</h2>
As the organization does not allow other to have write access, the <i>project_k.txt</i> file is in violation. </br>
Changing it via: <i>chmod o-w project_k.txt</i>

<h2>Change file permissions on a hidden file</h2>
The <i>.project_x.txt</i> file was archived, which is why it’s hidden. </br>
It should not have write permissions for anyone, but the user and group should be able to read the file.

Changed permissions via: <i>chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project_x.txt</i>


<h2>Change directory permissions</h2>
The files and directories in the projects directory belong to the <i>researcher2 user</i>. </br>
Only <i>researcher2</i> should be allowed to access the <i>drafts</i> directory and its contents.
</br></br>

Checked permissions via: <i>ls -la</i> </br>

Changed via: <i>chmod g-x drafts</i> </br>

<h2>Summary</h2>
Verified users on the team were authorized with the appropriate permissions. I examined existing permissions on the file system and modified the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access using the following Linux commands: </br>
<i>ls -la</i> to check files/directory permissions, including hidden files, and chmod to change permissions for files/directories
